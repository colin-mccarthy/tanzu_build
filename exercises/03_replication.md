## Set up a Registry Endpoint

Whether doing replication or proxy, you need to configure Dockerhub as a replication endpoint.

Go to Administration -> Registries and click the + New Endpoint button.

Set the Provider and Name both to `Docker Hub`.

You can leave the rest of the settings as default, unless you want access to private images, in which case add in your Access ID and Access Secret.
